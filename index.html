                    <h2>BGP Overview</h2>
                    <p>&copy Cisco</p>
                    <p>BGP is an external gateway protocol, meant to be used between different networks. It is the protocol used between Internet service providers (ISPs) and also can be used between an Enterprise and an ISP. BGP was built for reliability, scalability, and control, not speed.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>BGP stands for Border Gateway Protocol. Routers running BGP are termed BGP speakers.</li>
                        <li>BGP uses the concept of autonomous systems (AS). An autonomous system is a group of networks under a common administration. The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) assigns AS numbers: 1 to 64511 are public AS numbers and 64512 to 65535 are private AS numbers.</li>
                        <li>Autonomous systems run Interior Gateway Protocols (IGP) within the system. They run an Exterior Gateway Protocol (EGP) between them. BGP version 4 is the only EGP currently in use.</li>
                        <li>Routing between autonomous systems is called interdomain routing.</li>
                        <li>The administrative distance for EBGP routes is 20. The administrative distance for IBGP routes is 200.</li>
                        <li>BGP neighbors are called peers and must be statically configured.</li>
                        <li>BGP uses TCP port 179. BGP peers exchange incremental, triggered route updates and periodic keepalives.</li>
                        <li>Routers can run only one instance of BGP at a time.</li>
                        <li>BGP is a path-vector protocol. Its route to a network consists of a list of autonomous systems on the path to that network.</li>
                        <li>BGP's loop prevention mechanism is an autonomous system number. When an update about a network leaves an autonomous system, that autonomous system's number is prepended to the list of autonomous systems that have handled that update. When an autonomous system receives an update, it examines the autonomous system list. If it finds its own autonomous system number in that list, the update is discarded.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>MPLS Overview</h2>
                    <p>&copy Huawei</p>
                    <p>The Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) Protocol is used on Internet Protocol (IP) backbone networks. MPLS uses connection-oriented label switching on connectionless IP networks. By combining Layer 3 routing technologies and Layer 2 switching technologies, MPLS leverages the flexibility of IP routing and the simplicity of Layer 2 switching. MPLS is based on Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4). The core MPLS technology can be extended to multiple network protocols, such as Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6), Internet Packet Exchange (IPX), and Connectionless Network Protocol (CLNP). "Multiprotocol" in MPLS means that multiple network protocols are supported. MPLS is used for tunneling but not a service or an application.</p>
                    <p>MPLS supports multiple protocols and services. Moreover, it ensures security of data transmission.</p>
                    <p>The MPLS architecture has the following parts:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Control plane: generates and maintains routing and label information</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Routing information base (RIB): is generated by IP routing protocols and used to select routes.</li>
                            <li>Label distribution protocol (LDP): allocates labels, creates a label information base (LIB), and establishes and tears down LSPs.</li>
                            <li>Label information base (LIB): is generated by LDP and used to manage labels.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Forwarding plane (data plane): forwards IP packets and MPLS packets</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Forwarding information base (FIB): is generated based on routing information obtained from the RIB and used to forward common IP packets.</li>
                            <li>Label forwarding information base (LFIB): is created by LDP on an LSR and used to forward MPLS packets.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Makes decisions about where traffic is sent</li>
                        <li>Control plane packets are destined to or locally originated by the router itself</li>
                        <li>The control plane functions include the system configuration, management, and exchange of routing table information</li>
                        <li>The route controller exchanges the topology information with other routers and constructs a routing table based on a routing protocol, for example, RIP, OSPF or BGP</li>
                        <li>Control plane packets are processed by the router to update the routing table information.</li>
                        <li>It is the Signalling of the network</li>
                        <li>Since the control functions are not performed on each arriving individual packet, they do not have a strict speed constraint and are less time-critical</li>

                        <li>Forwards traffic to the next hop along the path to the selected destination network according to control plane logic</li>
                        <li>Data plane packets go through the router</li>
                        <li>The routers/switches use what the control plane built to dispose of incoming and outgoing frames and packets</li>

                    <h2>SDWAN Overview</h2>
                    <p>&copy SDx Central</p>
                    <p>The software-defined wide-area network (SD-WAN or SDWAN) is a specific application of software-defined networking (SDN) technology applied to WAN connections such as broadband internet, 4G, LTE, or MPLS. It connects enterprise networks — including branch offices and data centers — over large geographic distances.</p>
                    <p>A WAN might be used, for example, to connect branch offices to a central corporate network, or to connect data centers separated by distance. In the past, WAN connections often used technology that required special proprietary hardware. SD-WAN, on the other hand, utilizes the internet or cloud-native private networks. SD-WAN decouples the network from the management plane and detaches the traffic management and monitoring functions from hardware. It relies on four central components:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Edge Connectivity Abstraction</li>
                        <li>WAN Virtualization</li>
                        <li>Policy-Driven, Centralized Management</li>
